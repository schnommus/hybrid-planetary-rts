-Add LevelEditing ProcessingSystem class; and put all level stuff in there.
-Show string of currently placing type
-Just pass everything relevent to the leveleditor which will hack it's way into other systems (if necessary)
-It should be possible to render terrain nodes within the leveleditor class without interfering with the RenderSystem
-Gotta delete nodes that are nearby within a threshold.
-Also just adding a delete function in the first place would be useful
